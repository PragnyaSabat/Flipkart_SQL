🚚 Logistics Optimization for Delivery Routes – Flipkart
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing Flipkart’s delivery operations by analyzing logistics data using SQL. With increasing order volumes across metros and Tier-2/Tier-3 cities, delivery delays, route inefficiencies, and warehouse bottlenecks significantly impact operational cost and customer satisfaction.

Using relational logistics datasets, this project builds a SQL-driven analytics system to identify inefficiencies, analyze delays, evaluate warehouse and agent performance, and recommend route optimization strategies.

As described in the problem statement 

C4_ Project_ Logistics Optimiza…

, the objective is to leverage structured query techniques to extract meaningful business insights from logistics data.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze delivery delays and identify root causes.

Optimize route performance using efficiency metrics.

Evaluate warehouse and agent productivity.

Build advanced KPIs for operational decision-making.

Provide actionable, data-driven recommendations for logistics improvement.

📊 Key Analytical Modules
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed duplicate Order_ID records.

Imputed null Traffic_Delay_Min with route-level averages.

Standardized date formats (YYYY-MM-DD).

Flagged invalid delivery records.

2️⃣ Delivery Delay Analysis

Calculated delivery delay (in days) per order.

Identified Top 10 delayed routes.

Ranked orders by delay within each warehouse.

3️⃣ Route Optimization Insights

Computed:

Average delivery time

Average traffic delay

Distance-to-time efficiency ratio

Identified routes with:

Worst efficiency ratio

20% delayed shipments

Generated route optimization recommendations.

4️⃣ Warehouse Performance Analysis

Ranked warehouses by:

Processing time

On-time delivery percentage

Identified bottleneck warehouses using CTEs.

Compared total vs delayed shipments.

5️⃣ Delivery Agent Performance

Ranked agents by on-time percentage (route-wise).

Identified underperforming agents (<80% on-time).

Compared top 5 vs bottom 5 agents’ average speed.

Suggested performance improvement strategies.

6️⃣ Shipment Tracking Analytics

Extracted last checkpoint per order.

Identified most common delay reasons.

Flagged shipments with >2 delayed checkpoints.

7️⃣ Advanced KPI Reporting

Average delivery delay per region.

On-time delivery percentage.

Average traffic delay per route.

📈 Business Insights & Impact

This project enables:

Identification of high-delay routes.

Detection of warehouse bottlenecks.

Performance benchmarking of delivery agents.

Optimization opportunities for inefficient routes.

Improved operational visibility using SQL-based KPIs.

The system supports data-driven decision-making to reduce delays, lower logistics costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.
